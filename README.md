Close the launcher if its open
Then go to C:\temp\VentileClient\Launcher and delete everything inside
Then download this .zip file into C:\temp\VentileClient\Launcher (https://github.com/DeathlyBower959/Ventile-Client-Downloads/blob/2d8d7313254ac0dfc58435662a2630f910edb711/VentileClient.zip?raw=true)
